A note:
I did not have access to a Windows machine, so I wrote this on my mac using Xamarin Studio and mono. As such, the build script that I work is a shell script that I am not sure will work on a Windows machine. I apologize for the inconvenience.

The test script I used was “testscript.sh”. I added a windows test script called “testscriptwindows”, but I was unable to test it in my machine. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about my code, and I hope to hear feedback soon.
